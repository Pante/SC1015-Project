# SC1015 Project

This repository contains the relevant datasets and Jupyter Notebooks for the SC1015 mini project. Our mini project uses
the [Steam Games Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/trolukovich/steam-games-complete-dataset).

## Motivation & Problem Statement

Pre-ordering and buying games within a few days after launch is often fraught with peril. Consumers are often unable to 
predict how "good" the game is while pre-ordering and buying the game early. On Steam, consumers often use other users' reviews
as a proxy metric for "good" when deciding whether to purchase a game. However, said users' reviews need to be aggregated 
and are often only available a day after launch. Yet we do not want to end up purchasing another [No Man's Sky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Man%27s_Sky#At_release) (a game that was initially praised by critics before launch, but widely panned upon launch). In short, we want to be able to predict how "good" is a game/make an informed decision when pre-ordering and buying games early.

To tackle this conundrum with pre-ordering and buying game early, we formulate the following question:
* Can we predict if a game is good (users' reviews are "mostly positive") based on its attributes?
