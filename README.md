# SC1015 Project

This repository contains the relevant datasets and Jupyter Notebooks for the SC1015 mini project. Our mini project uses
the [Steam Games Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/trolukovich/steam-games-complete-dataset).

## Motivation & Problem Statement

Pre-ordering and buying games early is risky. Consumers cannot predict how "good" the game will be. On steam, consumers
often use `users' reviews` as a proxy metric for how "good" a game is. However, this metric needs to be aggregated and is
often only available a few days after launch. To make pre-ordering and buying games early less risky, we want to predict
how "good" a game is based on `users' reviews` as a proxy.

To do so, we formulate the following question:
* Can we predict how well received is a game (users' reviews are "mostly positive") based on its attributes?

## Learning Points

* [One-hot encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-hot) to encode columns that contain a list of values.
* [Pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) file format for serializing/deserializing prepared data efficiently.
